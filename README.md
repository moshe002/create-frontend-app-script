Practicing bash scripting.

Frontend frameworks available are handled with vite: https://vite.dev/

Script only works on Windows, I haven't tried linux or macOS.

To execute the script:
- open git bash
- type './createfrontendapp.sh

Steps are shown when the script is executed and are straightforward.
